Situation Generator — Definitions

Global rules

Random behavior
If a field is set to “Random”, the app generates that field using the rules below for the selected mode and difficulty.

Hash weighting
Two Minute / Four Minute / Coming Out
Left 40%
Right 40%
Middle 12%
Left Middle 4%
Right Middle 4%

Red Zone / Normal Downs
Left 37%
Right 37%
Middle 15%
Left Middle 6%
Right Middle 6%

Yard line weighting
Yard line selection is weighted on every mode that generates a yard line.
The app filters to the allowed yard-line range for that mode/difficulty, then re-normalizes probabilities while keeping the same relative likelihoods.
Normal Downs table is used as the primary yard probability set; if a yard value is missing there, the Two Minute yard likelihood table is used as fallback.
Red Zone uses its own Red Zone yard probability table.

Score phrase generation (Leading / Trailing / Tied)
The app selects an opponent score from a weighted list of allowed scores, then derives the offense score by applying the score differential.
Both scores must be positive or zero, must be in the allowed score list, and can never be 1, 2, 4, or 5.
Output is:
Leading X–Y (positive differential)
Trailing X–Y (negative differential)
Tied X–Y (zero differential)

0 (10), 1 (30), 2 (35), 3 (25)

Yard Line (if Yard Line = Random)
Uses the global yard probability, filtered to the allowed range for the selected difficulty, then re-normalized.

Clock (if Clock = Random)
Random: 4:30–4:00 OR 3:59–3:00 OR 2:59–2:30

Score Differential (if Score Differential = Random)
Random: +1 to +8
Easy: +4 to +7
Easy-Medium: +4 to +7
Medium: +1 to +7
Medium-Hard: +1 to +7
Hard: +1 to +3

Yard Line (if Yard Line = Random)
Uses the global yard probability, filtered to the allowed range for the selected difficulty, then re-normalized.
Typical allowed ranges by difficulty are defined in code per difficulty (e.g., Hard is constrained tighter than Random).

Offensive Timeouts (if Offensive Timeouts = Random)
0, 1, 2, 3

Defensive Timeouts (if Defensive Timeouts = Random)
Random: 1, 2, 3
Easy: 1, 2
Easy-Medium: 1, 2
Medium: 1, 2
Medium-Hard: 2, 3
Hard: always 3

Red Zone

Slider buckets
Random: yard line selected from +20 to +1
Fringe: +30 to +21
High Red Zone: +20 to +12
Low Red Zone: +11 to +4
Goal Line: +3 to +1

Yard Line (if Yard Line = Random)
Weighted by the Red Zone yard probability table (30 down to 1), filtered to the bucket range, then re-normalized.

Score Differential options
Random, +3, +2, +1, 0, -1 to -8

Hash
Random (weighted per Red Zone hash rules) or user-selected.

Coming Out

User options
Yard Line: -1 to -10 (or Random)
Hash: Random (weighted per Coming Out hash rules)

Clock and quarter for the paragraph
Quarter: random 1–4
Clock: random between 15:00 and 2:00

Score differential for the paragraph
Random between -8 and +8, with score caps based on quarter and clock.

Score caps (maximum points allowed for either team)
Q1: max 7
Q2: >10:00 max 17, <10:00 max 24
Q3: >10:00 max 28, <10:00 max 31
Q4: >10:00 max 35, <10:00 no max

Yard line weighting
Yard line selection is weighted using the global yard probability, filtered to -1 through -10, then re-normalized.

Normal Downs

User options
None. The app generates the situation.

Yard line
Weighted using the Normal Downs yard probability table you provided (filtered to those values, then re-normalized).

Hash
Random (weighted per Normal Downs hash rules).

Paragraph (score/clock/quarter)
Same paragraph rules as Coming Out:
Quarter random 1–4
Clock random 15:00 to 2:00
Score differential random -8 to +8 with the same quarter/clock score caps
