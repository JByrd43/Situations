Situation Generator — Definitions

Global rules

Random behavior
If a field is set to “Random”, the app generates that field using the rules below for the selected mode and difficulty.

Hash weighting
Two Minute / Four Minute / Coming Out
Left 40%
Right 40%
Middle 12%
Left Middle 4%
Right Middle 4%

Yard line weighting
Yard line selection is weighted on every mode that generates a yard line.
The app filters to the allowed yard-line range for that mode/difficulty, then re-normalizes probabilities while keeping the same relative likelihoods.
Normal Downs table is used as the primary yard probability set; if a yard value is missing there, the Two Minute yard likelihood table is used as fallback.
Red Zone uses its own Red Zone yard probability table.

Score phrase generation (Leading / Trailing / Tied)
The app selects an opponent score from a weighted list of allowed scores, then derives the offense score by applying the score differential.
Both scores must be positive or zero, must be in the allowed score list, and can never be 1, 2, 4, or 5.
Output is:
Leading X–Y (positive differential)
Trailing X–Y (negative differential)
Tied X–Y (zero differential)
