Privacy Policy

Effective date: December 17, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Football Situation Generator (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Football Situation Generator mobile application (the “App”).

1. Overview
[APP NAME] is a utility app that generates football game situations and allows you to save favorites and share generated text. We do not require an account to use the App.

2. Information We Collect
a) Information you provide
- Favorites you choose to save in the App.
- Any content you choose to share using your device’s share features.

b) Automatically collected information
We do not intentionally collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, precise location, contacts, photos, or payment information.

c) Device permissions
The App may use system features you initiate (for example, the Share Sheet). We do not receive the contents of your messages or emails.

3. How We Use Information
We use information only to:
- Generate and display football situations.
- Store your favorites on your device.
- Enable sharing of the generated text when you request it.

4. Data Storage
Favorites are stored locally on your device and/or in iCloud via Apple’s standard mechanisms (if enabled on your device). We do not operate our own servers to store your favorites.

5. Sharing of Information
We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.
When you use the Share Sheet, your device and the service you choose (Messages, Mail, etc.) handle the transmission of the content you share.

6. Third-Party Services
The App may rely on Apple platform services (iOS, iCloud, Messages, Mail) to provide core functionality. Their handling of data is governed by Apple’s policies.

7. Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

8. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect information stored in the App. However, no method of storage is 100% secure.

9. Your Choices
- You can delete favorites at any time within the App.
- You can uninstall the App to remove locally stored data.

10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated policy will be posted at the same location with a revised effective date.
